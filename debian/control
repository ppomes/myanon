Description: mysqldump anonymizer
 Myanon is a streaming anonymizer for MySQL dump files. It reads a mysqldump
 from standard input and writes an anonymized version to standard output.
 .
 It supports many anonymization methods including deterministic hashing
 (texthash, emailhash, inthash), fixed value replacement, substrings,
 key-based and index-based transformations, and custom Python functions.
 It can also anonymize JSON fields embedded in SQL strings and truncate
 entire tables. All hashing methods use HMAC-SHA256 with a configurable
 secret to preserve referential integrity across the dump.
 .
 Myanon is configured via a simple configuration file that maps database
 table columns to anonymization rules.
